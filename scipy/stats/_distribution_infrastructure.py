#  Make ShiftedScaledDistribution more efficient - only process underlying
#   distribution parameters as necessary.
#  Reconsider `all_inclusive`
#  Should process_parameters update kwargs rather than returning? Should we
#   update parameters rather than setting to what process_parameters returns?

# Questions:
# 1.  I override `__getattr__` so that distribution parameters can be read as
#     attributes. We don't want uses to try to change them.
#     - To prevent replacements (dist.a = b), I could override `__setattr__`.
#     - To prevent in-place modifications, `__getattr__` could return a copy,
#       or it could set the WRITEABLE flag of the array to false.
#     Which should I do?
# 2.  `cache_policy` is supported in several methods where I imagine it being
#     useful, but it needs to be tested. Before doing that:
#     - What should the default value be?
#     - What should the other values be? Currently there is an enum, but
#       I find this to be cumbersome.
# 3.  `iv_policy` is supported in a few places, but it should be checked for
#     consistency. I have the same questions as for `cache_policy`.
# 4.  `tol` is currently notional. I think there needs to be way to set
#     separate `atol` and `rtol`. Some ways I imagine it being used:
#     - Values can be passed to iterative functions (quadrature, root-finder).
#     - To control which "method" of a distribution function is used. For
#       example, if `atol` is set to `1e-12`, it may be acceptable to compute
#       the complementary CDF as 1 - CDF even when CDF is nearly 1; otherwise,
#       a (potentially more time-consuming) method would need to be used.
#     I'm looking for unified suggestions for the interface, not individual
#     ideas like "you could do this here."
# 5.  I also envision that accuracy estimates should be reported to the user
#     somehow. I think my preference would be to return a subclass of an array
#     with an `error` attribute - yes, really. But this is unlikely to be
#     popular, so what are other ideas? Again, we need a unified vision here,
#     not just pointing out difficulties (not all errors are known or easy
#     to estimate, what to do when errors could compound, etc.).
# 6.  `kwargs` is used in many places to refer to the dictionary of
#      distribution parameters (e.g. as passed from the public function to a
#      private function). Shall I change this to `parameters`?
# 7.  The term "method" is used to refer to public instance functions,
#     private instance functions, the "method" string argument, and the means
#     of calculating the desired quantity (represented by the string argument).
#     For the sake of disambiguation, shall I rename the "method" string to
#     "strategy" and refer to the means of calculating the quantity as the
#     "strategy"?

# Originally, I planned to filter out invalid distribution parameters for the
# author of the distribution; they would always work with "compressed",
# 1D arrays containing only valid distribution parameters. There are two
# problems with this:
# - This essentially requires copying all arrays, even if there is only a
#   single invalid parameter combination. This is expensive. Then, to output
#   the original size data to the user, we need to "decompress" the arrays
#   and fill in the NaNs, so more copying. Unless we branch the code when
#   there are no invalid data, these copies happen even in the normal case,
#   where there are no invalid parameter combinations. We should not incur
#   all this overhead in the normal case.
# - For methods that accept arguments other than distribution parameters, the
#   user will pass in arrays that are broadcastable with the original arrays,
#   not the compressed arrays. This means that this same sort of invalid
#   value detection needs to be repeated every time one of these methods is
#   called.
#   The much simpler solution is to keep the data uncompressed but to replace
#   the invalid parameters and arguments with NaNs (and only if some are
#   invalid). With this approach, the copying happens only if/when it is
#   needed. Most functions involved in stats distribution calculations don't
#   mind NaNs; they just return NaN. The behavior "If x_i is NaN, the result
#   is NaN" is explicit in the array API. So this should be fine.
#   I'm also going to leave the data in the original shape. The reason for this
#   is that the user can process distribution parameters as needed and make
#   them @cached_properties. If we leave all the original shapes alone, the
#   input to functions like `pdf` that accept additional arguments will be
#   broadcastable with these @cached_properties. In most cases, this is
#   completely transparent to the author.
#
#   Another important decision is that the *private* methods must accept
#   the distribution parameters as inputs rather than relying on these
#   cached properties directly (although the public methods typically pass
#   the cached values to the private methods). This is because the elementwise
#   algorithms for quadrature, differentiation, root-finding, and minimization
#   require that the input functions are strictly elementwise in the sense
#   that the value output for a given input element does not depend on the
#   shape of the input or that element's location within the input array.
#   When the computation has converged for an element, it is removed from
#   the computation entirely. The shape of the arrays passed to the
#   function will almost never be broadcastable with the shape of the
#   cached parameter arrays.
#
#   Need to work a bit more on caching. It's not as fast as I'd like it to be.
#   lru_cache for methods that don't accept additional arguments would be
#   great, but it can't easily be turned off by the user. With a custom
#   cache, we can easily add options that disabled or cleared it as needed.
#   Perhaps there is a way to wrap `lru_cache` or the function wrapped by
#   `lru_cache` to add that in.
#
#   I've sprinkled in some optimizations for scalars and same-shape/type arrays
#   throughout. The biggest time sinks before were:
#   - broadcast_arrays
#   - result_dtype
#   - is_subdtype
#   It is much faster to check whether these are necessary than to do them.

        ----------
        size : tuple of ints
            The shape of the array of valid values to be drawn. For now,
            all values are uniformly sampled from within the `typical` range,
            but we should add options for picking more challenging values (e.g.
            including endpoints; out-of-bounds values; extreme values).
        rng : np.Generator
            The Generator used for drawing random values.
        domain : str
            The domain of the `_Parameter` from which to draw. Default is
            "domain" (the *full* domain); alternative is "typical". An
            enhancement would give a way to interpolate between the two.
        proportions : tuple of numbers
            A tuple of four non-negative numbers that indicate the expected
            relative proportion of elements that:

            - are strictly within the domain,
            - are at one of the two endpoints,
            - are strictly outside the domain, and
            - are NaN,

            respectively. Default is (1, 0, 0, 0). The number of elements in
            each category is drawn from the multinomial distribution with
            `np.prod(size)` as the number of trials and `proportions` as the
            event probabilities. The values in `proportions` are automatically
            normalized to sum to 1.

    ### Distribution properties
    # The following "distribution properties" are exposed via a public method
    # that accepts only options (not distribution parameters or quantile/
    # percentile argument).
    # support
    # logentropy, entropy,
    # median, mode, mean,
    # variance, std
    # skewness, kurtosis
    # Common options are:
    # method - a string that indicates which method should be used to compute
    #          the quantity (e.g. a formula or numerical integration).
    # cache_policy - an enum that indicates whether the value should be cached
    #                for later retrieval.
    # Input/output validation is provided by the `_set_invalid_nan_property`
    # decorator. These are the methods meant to be called by users.
    #
    # Each public method calls a private "dispatch" method that
    # determines which "method" (strategy for calculating the desired quantity)
    # to use by default and, via the `@_dispatch` decorator, calls the
    # method and computes the result.
    # Dispatch methods always accept:
    # method - as passed from the public method
    # kwargs - a dictionary of distribution shape parameters passed by
    #          the public method.
    # Dispatch methods accept `kwargs` rather than relying on the state of the
    # object because iterative algorithms like `_tanhsinh` and `_chandrupatla`
    # need their callable to follow a strict elementwise protocol: each element
    # of the output is determined solely by the values of the inputs at the
    # corresponding location. The public methods do not satisfy this protocol
    # because they do not accept the parameters as arguments, producing an
    # output that generally has a different shape than that of the input. Also,
    # by calling "dispatch" methods rather than the public methods, the
    # iterative algorithms avoid the overhead of input validation.
    #
    # Each dispatch method can designate the responsibility of computing
    # the required value to any of several "implementation" methods. These
    # methods accept only `**kwargs`, the parameter dictionary passed from
    # the public method via the dispatch method. We separate the implementation
    # methods from the dispatch methods for the sake of simplicity (via
    # compartmentalization) and to allow subclasses to override certain
    # implementation methods (typically only the "formula" methods). The names
    # of implementation methods are combinations of the public method name and
    # the name of the "method" (strategy for calculating the desired quantity)
    # string. (In fact, the name of the implementation method is calculated
    # from these two strings in the `_dispatch` decorator.) Common method
    # strings are:
    # formula - distribution-specific analytical expressions to be implemented
    #           by subclasses.
    # log/exp - Compute the log of a value and then exponentiate it or vice
    #           versa.
    # quadrature - Compute the value via numerical integration.
    #
    # The default method (strategy) is determined based on what implementation
    # methods are available and the error tolerance of the user. Typically,
    # a formula is always used if available. We fall back to "log/exp" if a
    # formula for the logarithm or exponential of the quantity is available,
    # and we use quadrature otherwise.

    ### Sampling Functions
    # The following functions for drawing samples from the distribution are

    # shape of the sample - and keyword options (but not distribution
    # parameters).
    # sample
    # ~~qmc_sample~~ built into sample now
    #
    # Common keyword options include:
    # method - a string that indicates which method should be used to compute
    #          the quantity (e.g. a formula or numerical integration).
    # rng - the NumPy Generator object to used for drawing random numbers.
    #
    # Input/output validation is included in each function, since there is
    # little code to be shared.
    # These are the methods meant to be called by users.
    #
    # Each public method calls a private "dispatch" method that
    # determines which "method" (strategy for calculating the desired quantity)
    # to use by default and, via the `@_dispatch` decorator, calls the
    # method and computes the result.
    # Each dispatch method can designate the responsibility of sampling to any
    # of several "implementation" methods. These methods accept only
    # `**kwargs`, the parameter dictionary passed from the public method via
    # the "dispatch" method.

    ### Moments
    # The moment calculation functions are exposed via a public method that
    # accepts only one positional argument - the order of the moment - and
    # keyword options (not distribution parameters or quantile/percentile
    # argument).
    # moment_raw
    # moment_central
    # moment_standard
    #
    # Common options are:
    # method - a string that indicates which method should be used to compute
    #          the quantity (e.g. a formula or numerical integration).
    # cache_policy - an enum that indicates whether the value should be cached
    #                for later retrieval.
    # Like the distribution properties, input/output validation is provided by
    # the `_set_invalid_nan_property` decorator.
    #
    # Like most public methods above, each public method calls a private
    # "dispatch" method that determines which "method" (strategy for
    # calculating the desired quantity) to use. Also, each dispatch method can
    # designate the responsibility computing the moment to one of several
    # "implementation" methods.
    # Unlike the dispatch methods above, however, the `@_dispatch` decorator
    # is not used, and both logic and method calls are included in the function
    # itself.
    # Instead of determining which method will be used based solely on the
    # implementation methods available and calling only the corresponding
    # implementation method, *all* the implementation methods are called
    # in sequence until one returns the desired information. When an
    # implementation methods cannot provide the requested information, it
    # returns the object None (which is distinct from arrays with NaNs or infs,
    # which are valid values of moments).
    # The reason for this approach is that although formulae for the first
    # few moments of a distribution may be found, general formulae that work
    # for all orders are not always easy to find. This approach allows the
    # developer to write "formula" implementation functions that return the
    # desired moment when it is available and None otherwise.
    #
    # Note that the first implementation method called is a cache. This is
    # important because lower-order moments are often needed to compute
    # higher moments from formulae, so we eliminate redundant calculations
    # when moments of several orders are needed.

    ### Fitting
    # All methods above treat the distribution parameters as fixed, and the
    # variable argument may be a quantile or probability. The fitting functions
    # are fundamentally different because the quantiles (often observations)
    # are considered to be fixed, and the distribution parameters are the
    # variables. In a sense, they are like an inverse of the sampling
    # functions.
    #
    # At first glance, it would seem ideal for `fit` to be a classmethod,
    # called like `LogUniform.fit(sample=sample)`.
    # I tried this. I insisted on it for a while. But if `fit` is a
    # classmethod, it cannot call instance methods. If we want to support MLE,
    # MPS, MoM, MoLM, then we end up with most of the distribution functions
    # above needing to be classmethods, too. All state information, such as
    # tolerances and the underlying distribution of `ShiftedScaledDistribution`
    # and `OrderStatisticDistribution`, would need to be passed into all
    # methods. And I'm not really sure how we would call `fit` as a
    # classmethod of a transformed distribution - maybe
    # ShiftedScaledDistribution.fit would accept the class of the
    # shifted/scaled distribution as an argument?
    #
    # In any case, it was a conscious decision for the infrastructure to
    # treat the parameters as "fixed" and the quantile/percentile arguments
    # as "variable". There are a lot of advantages to this structure, and I
    # don't think the fact that a few methods reverse the fixed and variable
    # quantities should make us question that choice. It can still accomodate
    # these methods reasonably efficiently.

# Rough sketch of how we might shift/scale distributions. The purpose of
# making it a separate class is just for

# b) avoiding the requirement that every distribution accept loc/scale.
# The simplicity of ContinuousDistribution is important, because there are
# several other distribution transformations to be supported; e.g., truncation,
# wrapping, folding, and doubling. We wouldn't want to cram all of this
# into the `ContinuousDistribution` class. Also, the order of the composition
# matters (e.g. truncate then shift/scale or vice versa). It's easier to
# accommodate different orders if the transformation is built up from
# components rather than all built into `ContinuousDistribution`.
